Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.

Python is often described as a 'batteries included' language due to its comprehensive standard library.
