Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software,
libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.
